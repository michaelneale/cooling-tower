= Cooling Tower - java web app deployment via deltacloud

= IMPORTANT NOTE
== This project is deprecated, retired. 
It's dead Jim. 

Well not dead - it has come back to life as SteamCannon.org - so please head on over there for all the goodness. 

Thanks for playing !



== Summary
CoolingTower builds on deltacloud.org to provide a simple way to intelligently deploy web apps. Deltacloud is an api that abstracts away the differences between cloud providers.
With CoolingTower you deploy your web app (say, a war) and it will work out where to run it, how to run it, and start and stop instances of the appropriate type if needed (via deltacloud).

== How it works
Currently CT has a RESTEasy provided api: 
Using a rulebase (via drools) there are some pre configured rules that match up apps with containers (a container is app server + server instance running somewhere in the cloud), and if necessary, select appropriate images and flavors for a new cloud server. This is designed to keep costs low, so it will only startup servers as needed, using a suitable flavor, and then shutting down when not needed. Of course being rules, these can be tuned over time !

== Usage of REST api (draft)
   GET /cooling-tower -- get a list of links to something like the following:
   POST /cooling-tower/applications --- post the war/app contents, will return a link to status
   GET /cooling-tower/applications/your-app -- return the status of it (where it is running, if it is ready etc)
   POST /cooling-tower/applications/your-app -- update the version
   DELETE /cooling-tower/applications/your-app -- decommission the app (may result in some server savings)
   GET /cooling-tower/applications -- list the apps available and status


== Status and roadmap
Current status is Very Early PoC - not all moving pieces are yet, uhhh... moving. As some credentials need to be cached, care must be taken. 
Integration with JOPR is required: most likely in the form of a plugin to make JOPR aware of cloud fabrics, and also allow deployment via CT from JOPR console.
The current agent functionality is (probably) adequate for this. 
Further: 
* Database provisioning
* Auto Cluster configuration
* DNS registration of app name
* Eclipse plugin


=== Usage Examples
TBD (curl, ant etc...)
